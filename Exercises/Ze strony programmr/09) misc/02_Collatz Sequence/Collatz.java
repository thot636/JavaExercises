An algorithm given by Lothar Collatz produces sequences of integers, and is described as follows:

Step 1: Choose an arbitrary positive integer A as the first item in the sequence.
Step 2: If A = 1 then stop.
Step 3: If A is even, then replace A by A / 2 and go to step 2.
Step 4: If A is odd, then replace A by 3 * A + 1 and go to step 2.

Write a program which calculates Collatz Sequence.

for ex:

1) the collatz sequence for 7 is 7 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1.
2) the collatz sequence for 15 is 15 46 23 70 35 106 53 160 80 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1.
