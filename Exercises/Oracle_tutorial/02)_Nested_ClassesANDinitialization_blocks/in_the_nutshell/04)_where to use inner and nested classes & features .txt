good example:

http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/java-questions/when-to-use-inner-classes-in-java/


in short:

you have GUI window to chat and you need to write to types of methods:
1)  logic methods, like e.g. writing input text in StringBuffer, or sending input text to other side via RMI

2) u need method which capture events (like pressing enter) and then invoke "logic method" responsible for sending text via RMI

that's y u create main class which have 'logic methods' and inner class which will have events and handler method 

*** ADVENTAGES ****
01) inner class have access to private members of outer classes
02) inner classes can inherit different class and outer can inherit different class as well.
03) the are separated but together :p

** Features ***

Static nested classes need to use instance's variable to use outer class instance fields & methods (static one works fine) thus cannot access private member of outer class ( non-static inner class - can access private fields of outer class). That's why when u wanna have access to fileds and methods of outer class use non-static inner class 

Non static inner class can have access to private fields & metohds outer class., but they cannot decalre any static fields, metohds in their bodies...
